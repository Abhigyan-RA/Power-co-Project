# PowerCo-Project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer churn of PowerCo. The project involved the following key tasks:

- **Data Identification and Strategy**: Identifying essential client data and outlining a strategic investigation approach.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducting efficient data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- **Data Visualization**: Employing data visualization techniques to interpret trends and insights.
- **Model Engineering**: Engineering and optimizing a random forest model to predict customer churn with an 85% accuracy rate.
- **Executive Summary**: Delivering a concise executive summary with actionable insights for the Associate Director.


# Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Key steps included:

- **Loading and Cleaning Data**: Ensuring the data is ready for analysis.
- **Visualizing Trends and Patterns**: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful visualizations.
- **Identifying Correlations**: Understanding the relationships between features and the target variable.

# Model Engineering

A random forest model was engineered and optimized to predict customer churn. Key steps included:

- **Data Splitting**: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance on the testing set.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model's accuracy through hyperparameter adjustments.

The final model achieved an 85% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn.

# Results

The analysis and model predictions provided actionable insights into customer churn patterns. The executive summary and findings presentation detail these insights and offer strategic recommendations for reducing churn.
